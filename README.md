## Nothing works yet, gimme some time :)

### Why this?
The main idea behind this project is to make a order system, that would save time waiting in line. You make your order, (for which you pay online) then you just pick it up.


### To do's
* Validate CSV input
* Set DB collation to UTF8
* Warn if database connection drops
* Display orders
* Come up with an idea how requests should look
* Make complete responses to client

### Future ideas
* Geolocation
